  First tip: when submitting work to GitHub, make sure to end your file name with .java
  
  By the way, this is a "block comment!" It starts with "/*" and ends with  the same thing but backwards. 
  These kinds of comments let you create comments for you
  to dump a ton of information in without having to squeeze it all on one line. It is useful for
  explaining what a whole program does altogether or for explaining your own thought process. 
  I will mainly use it to provide instructions or background information when giving you snippets of code. 
  They pretty much always go at the start of your code.

//this is a line comment and it starts with two slashes. They are for quick snippets of info describing a very small part of your code

/**
  This is a javadoc comment. It is like a block comment but starts with two asterisks instead of one. 
  These exist to detail exactly what the next structure is supposed to do. When you comment like this, 
  your IDE will actually bring up your description when you hover over it even if that code is somewhere in a different file,
  in case you forget what it does.
